# YOLO Weights of HRPlanesv2 Data Set

This repo contains weights of YOLOv5 and YOLOv4 models trained with HRPlanesv2 high resolution satellite imagery.

YOLOv4 trainings have been conducted using Darknet  open source neural network framework (https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) on a computer with NVIDIA GeForce 2080 Ti graphic card.

YOLOv5 trainings have been conducted on the Google Colab platform on the notebook cloned from the link https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.

## <div align="left">Details</div>
For YOLOv5, the developers recommend experiments between 300 and 1000 epochs. However the HRPlanesv2 is a large dataset that consists of high-resolution Google Earth images. Therefore, the YOLOv5 experiments have been realized as six different experiments, each consisting of 50 epochs.
